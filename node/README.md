Employed to build powerful, fast and scalable web applications using an event-driven, non-blocking IO asynchronous model, unlike PHP & Apache which involve single threads that take up memory

Node.js is accessed through the terminal by typing the command node
Individual JS files can also be executed using node by navigating to parent folder (`cd`) then calling
```node [file_name].js```
